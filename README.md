# I-am-Rich

This is the recreation of the infamous I am Rich app that had no functionality whatsoever and was once published in Apple and Google stores before getting removed 
from the stores after getting complaints about the app charging money for no functionality at all.

## Objective 

The project is a part of the "iOS Development Bootcamp" on "Udemy". This is the first project that I have created using swift. The purpose of creating this project
was to familiarise myself with the different elements and functionalities that are present in the XCode IDE and to get a feel of creating apps for iOS.
